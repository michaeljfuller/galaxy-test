# Galaxy Test

## Tech Notes
* No Redux store.
  * Not needed for anything in the test.
  * User data should be mastered by the session, since it is the *single source of truth*, rather than a Store.

## TO DO
* Get the font used in Figma.
* Check figma once I have internet access again.
* Replace mock auth with Auth0 at the end, and once I have internet access again.
* Re-check all cases against spec.
